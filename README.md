URL of the official Git repo on GitHub: https://github.com/Null-Entry/bitsplease.git
Matthew is designated team lead for project 3. He created the GitHub repo with our team name, BitsPlease, and is creating a new Maven project with IntelliJ. Samantha has notified Professor Pollock on our behalf of the members and team name and is helping build the GUI. Jennifer is editing the README.md file, and Michael is helping with the buttons on the GUI.
BitsPlease will be using the GitFlow workflow. We have all agreed to use UTF-8 for the projects file encoding, and the Windows line ending (/CRLF). 
Mathew and Jennifer worked on the main GUI, while Michael and Samantha worked on the other GUI. Mathew is going to push everything to main and update repo for class submission. Samantha and Mathew worked on the main GUI format while Michael and Jennifer added the search bar and updated the buttons. Samantha later updated the README.md file to show more of the work we each did.
We communicated daily using discord via text as well as voice and screen sharing.
